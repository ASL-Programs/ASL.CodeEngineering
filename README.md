# ASL.CodeEngineering

This repository contains the early skeleton of **ASL.CodeEngineering**, a polyglot
autonomous code engineering tool.

Run `dotnet build ASL.CodeEngineering.sln` to build all projects (requires the .NET SDK).

To launch the WPF application, run `dotnet run --project src/ASL.CodeEngineering.App`.
The UI uses WPF and therefore runs only on Windows systems.

## Testing

Unit tests are run with `dotnet test` from the repository root. You need a working .NET SDK and Python installation. Because the test project targets `net7.0-windows`, tests must run on Windows. Individual tests skip automatically when required tools such as `dotnet` or `python` are missing.

Initial structure for the autonomous polyglot code engineering system.

## Repository structure

- `ai_providers/` – additional AI provider implementations or third‑party
  integrations.
- `plugins/` – extensions that add functionality to the core tool.
- `knowledge_base/` – persistent learning data gathered by the agent.
- `data/` – runtime data generated by AI providers and the application.
- `logs/` – log files for debugging and audit.
- `code/` – workspace for generated or user‑provided code.
- `src/` – .NET source projects:
  - `ASL.CodeEngineering.App` – WPF application hosting the UI.
  - `ASL.CodeEngineering.AI` – library with the `IAIProvider` abstraction and
    sample providers (`EchoAIProvider`, `ReverseAIProvider`, `OpenAIProvider`).
- `tests/` – unit tests for the provider library.

You can override the default locations of the `ai_providers` and `plugins`
directories by setting the `AI_PROVIDERS_DIR` or `PLUGINS_DIR` environment
variables. The application also respects the following variables for runtime
data and logs:

- `DATA_DIR` – base directory for chat logs and provider data (defaults to
  `data/` beside the executable).
- `KB_DIR` – directory for generated summaries and other knowledge base
  files (defaults to `knowledge_base/`).
 - `LOGS_DIR` – directory for diagnostic logs (defaults to `logs/`). When this
   directory cannot be written to, logs fall back to a `logs/` folder located
   beside the executable.
 - `DISABLE_NETWORK_PROVIDERS` – set to `1` or `true` to remove providers that
  require internet access from the dropdown. Use this to enforce a fully offline
  workflow where all prompts stay inside the project directory.

## Extending AI providers

Providers must implement the `IAIProvider` interface defined in
`src/ASL.CodeEngineering.AI/IAIProvider.cs`.

1. Create a new **class library** project that references
   `ASL.CodeEngineering.AI` so your types can implement `IAIProvider`.
2. Build the library to produce a `.dll` file (any .NET language works).
3. Copy or move the resulting assembly into the `ai_providers/` directory
   located beside the application executable.

The application loads every provider assembly found in this folder automatically
at startup, so simply dropping a compiled DLL here makes it appear in the
provider list. You can override this search path by setting the
`AI_PROVIDERS_DIR` environment variable to point to a different directory.

If two providers share the same `Name` value, the duplicate is ignored and a warning
is logged at startup.

The example `OpenAIProvider` reads its API key from the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment
variable or a local `openai_api_key.txt` file. When using the file approach,
place `openai_api_key.txt` in the same directory as the built application
(for example `src/ASL.CodeEngineering.App/bin/Debug/net7.0-windows/`). The
repository `.gitignore` already excludes this file so you do not accidentally
commit your secret key.

## Extending plugins

Analyzer and code runner plugins work just like AI providers. Implement
`IAnalyzerPlugin` or `ICodeRunnerPlugin` in a class library that references
`ASL.CodeEngineering.AI`, build the assembly and drop the resulting DLL into
the `plugins/` directory next to the application executable. The application
automatically loads all plugins found in this folder at startup. Set the
`PLUGINS_DIR` environment variable if your plugins are located in a custom
directory. If a plugin uses the same name as a built-in component or another plugin,
the duplicate is ignored and a warning is logged.

## Choosing an AI provider

When the application starts, a dropdown appears at the top of the main window
listing all available providers. Select a provider (for example **Echo**,
**Reverse**, or **OpenAI**) before sending a prompt. The selection determines
which `IAIProvider` implementation handles your chat messages. If
`DISABLE_NETWORK_PROVIDERS` is enabled, only local providers such as **Echo** and
**Reverse** are available.

### Security and privacy

Providers such as `OpenAIProvider` communicate with external services over the
internet. Prompts and responses are transmitted to those providers, so avoid
sending confidential or sensitive information. API keys can be stored locally in
`openai_api_key.txt` if you prefer not to set environment variables.
Enable `DISABLE_NETWORK_PROVIDERS` to force the application into an offline
mode where only local providers are available and all data remains within the
project directory.

## Roadmap

The project aims to become a self‑improving polyglot engineer capable of using
the best language or tool for each task. Future updates will integrate more AI
providers, support plugins for new languages, and add automated learning loops
to continuously refine its own code base.

## Workflow files

Several markdown files capture the project's rules and decisions. Make sure to
review and update them as part of your development process:

- `AGENTS.md` – overarching roadmap and guidelines. Mark items complete here.
- `NEXT_STEPS.md` – running log of planned actions. Keep this file current as
  tasks progress.
- `REFERENCE_FILES.md` – list of documents or configs worth revisiting. Add
  entries whenever new references are created.
- `LANGUAGE_DECISIONS.md` – explains why each programming language or tool is
  used. Update it after significant changes.

Always consult these files before you start work and amend them whenever your
contributions affect the workflow.
