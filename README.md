# ASL.CodeEngineering

This repository contains the early skeleton of **ASL.CodeEngineering**, a polyglot
autonomous code engineering tool.

Run `dotnet build ASL.CodeEngineering.sln` to build all projects (requires the .NET SDK).

To launch the WPF application, run `dotnet run --project src/ASL.CodeEngineering.App`.

Tests can be run with `dotnet test` from the repository root. The .NET SDK must
be installed and no additional setup is required.

Initial structure for the autonomous polyglot code engineering system.

## Repository structure

- `ai_providers/` – additional AI provider implementations or third‑party
  integrations.
- `plugins/` – extensions that add functionality to the core tool.
- `knowledge_base/` – persistent learning data gathered by the agent.
- `data/` – runtime data generated by AI providers and the application.
- `logs/` – log files for debugging and audit.
- `code/` – workspace for generated or user‑provided code.
- `src/` – .NET source projects:
  - `ASL.CodeEngineering.App` – WPF application hosting the UI.
  - `ASL.CodeEngineering.AI` – library with the `IAIProvider` abstraction and
    sample providers (`EchoAIProvider`, `OpenAIProvider`).
- `tests/` – unit tests for the provider library.

## Extending AI providers

Providers must implement the `IAIProvider` interface defined in
`src/ASL.CodeEngineering.AI/IAIProvider.cs`. New providers can be placed under
`ai_providers/` and referenced from the application. The example
`OpenAIProvider` reads its API key from the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment
variable or a local `openai_api_key.txt` file.

## Roadmap

The project aims to become a self‑improving polyglot engineer capable of using
the best language or tool for each task. Future updates will integrate more AI
providers, support plugins for new languages, and add automated learning loops
to continuously refine its own code base.
