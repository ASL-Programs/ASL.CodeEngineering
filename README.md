# ASL.CodeEngineering

This repository contains the early skeleton of **ASL.CodeEngineering**, a polyglot
autonomous code engineering tool.

Run `dotnet build ASL.CodeEngineering.sln` to build all projects (requires the .NET SDK).

To launch the WPF application, run `dotnet run --project src/ASL.CodeEngineering.App`.
The UI uses WPF and therefore runs only on Windows systems.

Tests can be run with `dotnet test` from the repository root. The .NET SDK must
be installed and no additional setup is required. Because the test project
targets `net7.0-windows` with WPF, `dotnet test` must be run on a Windows
machine.

Initial structure for the autonomous polyglot code engineering system.

## Repository structure

- `ai_providers/` – additional AI provider implementations or third‑party
  integrations.
- `plugins/` – extensions that add functionality to the core tool.
- `knowledge_base/` – persistent learning data gathered by the agent.
- `data/` – runtime data generated by AI providers and the application.
- `logs/` – log files for debugging and audit.
- `code/` – workspace for generated or user‑provided code.
- `src/` – .NET source projects:
  - `ASL.CodeEngineering.App` – WPF application hosting the UI.
  - `ASL.CodeEngineering.AI` – library with the `IAIProvider` abstraction and
    sample providers (`EchoAIProvider`, `OpenAIProvider`).
- `tests/` – unit tests for the provider library.

## Extending AI providers

Providers must implement the `IAIProvider` interface defined in
`src/ASL.CodeEngineering.AI/IAIProvider.cs`.

1. Create a new **class library** project that references
   `ASL.CodeEngineering.AI` so your types can implement `IAIProvider`.
2. Build the library to produce a `.dll` file (any .NET language works).
3. Copy or move the resulting assembly into the `ai_providers/` directory
   located beside the application executable.

The application loads every provider assembly found in this folder automatically
at startup, so simply dropping a compiled DLL here makes it appear in the
provider list.

The example `OpenAIProvider` reads its API key from the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment
variable or a local `openai_api_key.txt` file. When using the file approach,
place `openai_api_key.txt` in the same directory as the built application
(for example `src/ASL.CodeEngineering.App/bin/Debug/net7.0-windows/`). The
repository `.gitignore` already excludes this file so you do not accidentally
commit your secret key.

## Extending plugins

Analyzer and code runner plugins work just like AI providers. Implement
`IAnalyzerPlugin` or `ICodeRunnerPlugin` in a class library that references
`ASL.CodeEngineering.AI`, build the assembly and drop the resulting DLL into
the `plugins/` directory next to the application executable. The application
automatically loads all plugins found in this folder at startup.

## Choosing an AI provider

When the application starts, a dropdown appears at the top of the main window
listing all available providers. Select a provider (e.g., **Echo** or
**OpenAI**) before sending a prompt. The selection determines which
`IAIProvider` implementation handles your chat messages.

### Security and privacy

Providers such as `OpenAIProvider` communicate with external services over the
internet. Prompts and responses are transmitted to those providers, so avoid
sending confidential or sensitive information. API keys can be stored locally in
`openai_api_key.txt` if you prefer not to set environment variables.

## Roadmap

The project aims to become a self‑improving polyglot engineer capable of using
the best language or tool for each task. Future updates will integrate more AI
providers, support plugins for new languages, and add automated learning loops
to continuously refine its own code base.
