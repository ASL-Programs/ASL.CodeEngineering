# ASL.CodeEngineering

This repository contains the early skeleton of **ASL.CodeEngineering**, a polyglot
autonomous code engineering tool. Currently the project includes:

- `ASL.CodeEngineering.App` – WPF application that hosts the main UI.
- `ASL.CodeEngineering.AI` – library defining the `IAIProvider` interface and a
  sample `EchoAIProvider`.

Run `dotnet build` on each project to compile (requires the .NET SDK).
