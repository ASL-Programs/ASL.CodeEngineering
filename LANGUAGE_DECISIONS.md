# LANGUAGE_DECISIONS.md

This document explains which programming languages and technologies are used across the project and why. It must be reviewed and updated after major changes as detailed in `AGENTS.md`.

## Language & Technology Decisions

### 1. Core UI (WPF): C#
- Reason: Native Windows integration, best for generating a portable `.exe`.

### 2. Data Analytics: R
- Reason: Provides strong statistical libraries.

### 3. Glue Code: Python
- Reason: Flexible scripting and excellent interoperability.

Add additional sections here whenever new languages or tools are adopted or plans change.
